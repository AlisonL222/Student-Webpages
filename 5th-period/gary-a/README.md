## About Me
Hi! I‚Äôm Alison L., a high school junior with a growing interest in technology and software development. This year in AP Computer Science Principles has played a major role in inspiring me to potentially pursue a major in software engineering. I‚Äôve always been curious about how things work behind the scenes, and programming has given me a creative and logical way to explore that interest.

## About This Project
This portfolio is a culmination of everything I‚Äôve learned throughout the year. It showcases the projects I built, highlights my growth as a programmer, and includes a personal profile that reflects who I am as a developer. Over the past year, I‚Äôve gained experience in both C++ and JavaScript, learning how to work with functions, arrays, loops (including nested loops), conditionals, operators, data types, and variables. I‚Äôve also developed a better understanding of how computers and the internet function. Most importantly, I‚Äôve built strong problem-solving and reasoning skills through debugging and project development.

## Portfolio Overview
- A modern, clean homepage  
- "About Me" section introducing my background and interests  
- A gallery of my coding projects with links and descriptions  
- Social media links for connecting and exploring more of my work  

## Featured Projects
- **Stopwatch**  
  A digital stopwatch that allows users to start, stop, and reset the timer.

- **To Do List**
