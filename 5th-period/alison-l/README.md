# Alison L
● I am a highschool junior potentially pursueing a major in software engineering thanks in part to learning programming in APCSP this year and to my long-standing interest in technology. <br><br>
● This project is a culmination of everything I've learned throughout the year. It serves as a window into what I've learned this year by featuring my projects from throughout the year and a profile about myself as a developer. This year I've learned the basics of both C++ and Javascript. In both programs I learned how to implement and call functions; how to create and use arrays; how loops and nested loops work; what conditionals and operators are; and about data types and variables. Outside of programming, I also learned about how the internet and computers operate. Additionally, I developed better reasoning and problem solving skills as we racked our minds over each project, problem, and bug.  <br><br>
● My portfolio site includes a home page, about me section, my projects from throughout the year, and links to my socials. <br><br>
● Projects:<br>
    --Stopwatch - It is a stopwatch that is able to record time and has the abilities to stop and be reset. <br>
    --To Do List - A to do list which allows users to add tasks to their to do list as well as ones from a list of suggested tasks. They are able to check off and delete each task on the list as well.<br>
    --Connect 4 - A recreation of the Connect 4 game where players compete against one another to get 4 tokens in a row. In this game, players can place their tokens on the board and if they achieve 4 in a row, they will win and the game will stop. Players are able to restart and play the game as many times as they'd like.<br><br>
