# Final Project Submission Instructions

Follow the steps below to correctly submit your final website project.  
Make sure you only edit inside your own class folder and do **not modify this README file**.

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Set Up Your Own Project Repository

You should already have your own GitHub repository for your final website project.  
In that repository, make sure you include:

- All your project files (`index.html`, `style.css`, images, JavaScript files, etc.)
- A new file called `README.md` (see below for instructions)

---

## 📄 What is a README.md?

A `README.md` file is a special file used to describe what your project is, how it works, and how to view or use it. GitHub automatically displays the contents of this file on your repo’s main page.

You are allowed to use **ChatGPT** to help you generate this file — that is the **only use of AI allowed** for this project.

---

### ✅ What to Include in Your README.md:

- Your first name and last initial
- A short paragraph about what this project is
- What you learned this year
- A list or description of the features in your portfolio
- A link to your GitHub repository
- A link to your live website (GitHub Pages or Netlify)

---

### ✅ Copy and Paste the Prompt Below Into ChatGPT:

> Can you write a professional `README.md` file for my final portfolio project?  
>  
> Include the following:  
> - A short introduction about me as a student developer. (My main portfolio page already has this, so you can include a **revised version of what I wrote there** in the README.)  
> - An overview of what my portfolio site includes  
> - A section that lists the projects featured in my portfolio, with a brief description of each project’s features or purpose  
> - A link to my GitHub repository: `https://github.com/yourusername/final-project-portfolio`  
> - A link to my live site that is running through GitHub Pages: `https://yourusername.github.io/final-project-portfolio/`

---

## 📁 Step 2: Submit Your Files to This Repo

Once your own repo is ready with all your files and your README, you need to submit a copy to **this class repo**.

1. Fork this repository (click “Fork” in the top-right)
2. Go to the folder for your class:  
   Example: `3rd-period/`
3. Inside that folder, create a **new folder** using your **first name and last initial**, lowercase and separated by a dash:  
   Example: `alex-g`
4. Upload all the same files from your own repo into that folder:
   - `index.html`, `style.css`, etc.
   - Your personal `README.md` file

---

## 💾 Step 3: Commit Your Files

1. Scroll down and add a commit message like:  
   `Add final project - Alex G.`
2. Click **“Commit changes”**

---

## 🔁 Step 4: Submit a Pull Request

1. Go back to the main page of your **forked copy of this class repository** (not your personal portfolio repo)  
2. Click **“Contribute” > “Open pull request”**  
3. Review your changes  
4. Click **“Create pull request”**  
5. Title it like:  
   `Final project submission - Alex G.`

---

## ✅ That’s It!

Once your pull request is submitted, I’ll review and merge your folder into the class repo.  
Just make sure:
- You only use AI for generating your `README.md`
- Your folder includes all the same files from your personal repo
- Your live site link and repo link are included in your `README.md`

Let me know if you have any questions or need help.
